- ✅ Backend: No known vulnerabilities in updated packages
- ✅ MCP: No known vulnerabilities in updated packages

### Builds
- ✅ Frontend production build successful
- ✅ Backend application starts successfully
- ✅ MCP server starts successfully

## Recommendations

1. **Monitor for Future Updates**: Set up automated dependency scanning to catch new vulnerabilities
2. **Regular Updates**: Schedule quarterly dependency reviews
3. **Security Scanning**: Integrate security scanning into CI/CD pipeline
4. **Testing**: Maintain comprehensive test coverage for easier updates

## Next Steps

1. Deploy updated dependencies to staging environment
2. Run full integration tests
3. Deploy to production with monitoring
4. Schedule next dependency review for Q1 2025
