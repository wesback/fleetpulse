# FleetPulse Environment Configuration
# Copy this file to .env and customize the values for your environment

# Data directory path for persistent storage
# Default: ./data (relative to docker-compose.yml location)
FLEETPULSE_DATA_PATH=./data

# Alternative examples:
# FLEETPULSE_DATA_PATH=/mnt/data/dockervolumes/fleetpulse
# FLEETPULSE_DATA_PATH=/home/user/fleetpulse-data

# Allowed CORS origins (comma-separated)
# Default: * (allow all origins)
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=*

# Example for production:
# ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://yourdomain.com,https://www.yourdomain.com

# Server Configuration
# Deployment mode: "uvicorn" (simple) or "gunicorn" (production)
# Default: uvicorn (recommended for single-container deployments)
# Use "gunicorn" for high-traffic production deployments
DEPLOYMENT_MODE=uvicorn

# When to use Uvicorn mode (DEPLOYMENT_MODE=uvicorn):
# - Single-container deployments (default recommended)
# - Development environments
# - Low to medium traffic (< 100 concurrent users)
# - Simplified setup and debugging
# - Lower memory footprint
# - Faster startup times

# When to use Gunicorn mode (DEPLOYMENT_MODE=gunicorn):
# - High-traffic production deployments (> 100 concurrent users)
# - Need for process-level fault tolerance
# - CPU-intensive workloads
# - Multi-core utilization requirements

# Number of Gunicorn workers (only used when DEPLOYMENT_MODE=gunicorn)
# Default: 2 (optimal for single-container deployment)
# For high-traffic deployments, consider increasing to 4-8
GUNICORN_WORKERS=2

# Database Configuration
# Force database recreation on startup (drops and recreates all tables)
# Default: false (recommended for production)
# Set to true for development/testing when you need to reset the database
FORCE_DB_RECREATE=false
